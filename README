Zile (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is a lightweight Emacs clone. Every Emacs
user should feel at home with Zile. Zile is aimed at small footprint
systems (a typical binary is about 100Kb) and quick editing sessions
(it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zile is written in ISO C using POSIX APIs; its only external
dependency is a terminal library, either termcap, Allegro or epocemx.

Zile is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

See INSTALL for installation instructions (on EPOC, just install the
SIS file).

Zile is hosted on SourceForge at http://zile.sourceforge.net/

Any questions, comments, or bug reports should be sent to the developers'
mailing list <zile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
