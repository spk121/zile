Release 2.3.13

This release fixes a bug in `scroll-up' and `scroll-down'.

Release 2.3.12

This release fixes the +LINE command-line action, which was broken a
few releases ago, and makes a cosmetic fix to temporary buffers.

Release 2.3.11

This release fixes a crash in `find-alternate-file', a build system
bug, and various cosmetic bugs, and cleans up the code a little.

Release 2.3.10

This release runs the test suite on Emacs as well as Zile (currently,
requires Emacs 23 or later), and contains many small fixes to both the
test suite and to Zile to improve Emacs compatibility. Various other
bug fixes, improvements and tidy-ups have also been made. Note in
particular that the commands `suspend-zile', `save-buffers-kill-zile'
and `view-zile-FAQ' are now called `suspend-emacs',
`save-buffers-kill-emacs' and `view-emacs-FAQ' respectively, and
`kill-line' now works with non-positive arguments. Portability has
been improved, in particular to DOS systems.

Release 2.3.9

This release fixes a build problem on OSF/1.

Release 2.3.8

This release fixes a crash in find-file-alternate, and another
potential crash.

Release 2.3.7

This release fixes a crash in query-replace and a highlighting bug,
both introduced in 2.3.5. Some code cleanup was done. A bug in the
build system that caused help2man to be required to build Zile was
removed.

Release 2.3.6:

This release fixes a build-system bug that caused Lua to be required
to build the release.

Release 2.3.5:

This release fixes a bug in write-file, where the undo state was not
properly updated, resulting in dirty states being marked clean. A
crash bug in paragraph filling was fixed, and some other minor bugs.
The --funcall option was reintroduced for backwards compatibility with
Zile 2.2. The build system was made more portable. Some code cleanup
was done.

Release 2.3.4:

This release fixes yet another bug in filename completion, and a
potential crash that the bug exposed. Some minor code cleanup was
performed.

Release 2.3.3:

This release fixes two more bugs in filename completion introduced in
2.3.1. Users of 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 should upgrade. Some minor code
cleanup was also performed.

Release 2.3.2:

This release fixes a bug in filename completion introduced in the
previous release that had serious results, and some minor problems in
the build system, and improves the installation instructions. help2man
is now needed to build Zile (and has been since 2.3.1). I'm sorry I
described DejaGnu as "flaky" in my previous release announcement; the
faults I encountered were those of the underlying expect/Tcl
combination, and not DejaGnu's.

Release 2.3.1:

This release contains a rewrite of the test suite which drives Zile
directly, as DejaGnu proved to be insufficiently portable, and too
flaky. Two commands have been added to make it possible to write all
the tests in Lisp, namely execute-kbd-macro and insert-char. The
--script flag is now --load, which is what it really does. Various
commands have been made to work non-interactively. Duplication has
been reduced by generating much of the documentation from the code.
The info manual, which was not particularly useful and only duplicated
information available elsewhere, has been removed. Other small fixes
and improvements have been made.

Release 2.3.0:

This release continues the code cleanup and portability fixes started
in 2.2.60. gnulib is now used extensively, and 2,000 lines of code, or
about 20% of the code base, has been removed by refactoring,
simplification, and use of gnulib. The new minor version number
reflects the magnitude of the change.

To try to limit the number of bugs introduced as a result, and to aid
future maintenance, a DejaGnu test suite has been added, which tests
almost all the interactive commands.

Many small bugs have been fixed, including cases where Zile did not
behave like Emacs; some small limitations of Zile with respect to
Emacs have been removed.

Users are for the most part encouraged to upgrade, as this release is
believed to be stable; however, cautious users may want to wait for
further 2.3.x releases, or for a suitable length of time to elapse.

Release 2.2.61:

This release uses gnulib for regex, getopt, vasprintf, and various
other features, rather than previous ad hoc solutions, to improve
portability.

Release 2.2.60:

This release attempts to improve portability by using gnulib for
various non-standard features instead of idiosyncratic code and making
various other fixes. Thanks to Nelson Beebe for reporting many build
problems on a wide range of platforms; unfortunately I've not been
able to establish how many of them this release fixes. A crash and
related bug on attempting to kill when mark and point are the same
have been fixed. Some fatal error messages have been improved.

Release 2.2.59:

This release fixes various problems with release 2.2.58, including
shipping the wrong source code (oops), and automates the GNU release
process so that errors of this sort should no longer happen. The build
system was tidied a little.

Release 2.2.58:

This release makes Zile's transition to being a GNU program. Note the
new web site, distribution URL and support addresses. This release
also fixes the display of errors that occur during startup.

Release 2.2.57:

This release changes the code to meet GNU coding standards. It's not
recommended for users because there are no (intended!) functional
changes whatsoever, and it's just possible that new bugs have been
introduced.

Release 2.2.56:

This release fixes a bug that prevented top-bit-set characters being
bindable to commands.

Release 2.2.55:

This release allows Zile to produce core dumps when it crashes,
handles SIGBUS, and fixes a crash caused by trying to bind a command
to the empty string.
