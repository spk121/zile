Changes between Zile 1.6.1 - Zile 1.7 BETA 2

Note: 1.7 BETA 2 was produced from 1.6.1, not 1.6.2, but all the same
fixes were applied.

* Changed configure script so no syntax colouring modes are built by
  default.
* Implemented Java Mode.  Contributed by Marius Nita <marius@cs.pdx.edu>.
* Implemented C# Mode.  Contributed by Josef 'Jupp' Schugt <jupp@gmx.de>.
* Implemented Mail Mode (plus the five variables `font-mailN' and
  the variable `mail-mode-auto-fill') as suggested by Josef Schugt.
* Implemented the widely-used Emacs bindings:
    - `forward-word' (bound to `M-f'), `backward-word' (bound to `M-b');
    - `capitalize-word' (bount to `M-c');
    - `upcase-word' (bount to `M-u'), `downcase-word' (bount to `M-l');
* Implemented `describe-key-briefly' (bound to `C-h c').
* Implemented `shrink-window' (bound to `M-e').  Contributed by Marius Nita.

* Now `quoted-insert' (bound to `C-q') accepts octal digits to
  insert particular characters.
* Cleaned up X Window terminal resize handling.  Low level SIGWINCH signal
  handling has been removed; now Zile relies only on ncurses KEY_RESIZE.
* The behavior of the `auto-font-lock' variable is changed in this version.
  Now the variable applies also to buffer mode changes.
* Fixed two old bugs thanks to Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>.

    * fixed bug in undo/redo;
    * fixed bug in highlight;

      problem;
